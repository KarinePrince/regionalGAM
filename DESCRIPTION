Description: This package is an implementation of the regional GAM method presented in Schmucki et al. 2015, an adaptation of the two-stage model developed by Dennis et al. 2013. This package compute the flight curve from a set of monitoring sites and compute the abudance index, using the flight curve to impute values where weekly counts are missing.
